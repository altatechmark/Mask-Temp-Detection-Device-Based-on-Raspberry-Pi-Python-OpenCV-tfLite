# Mask-Temp-Detection-Device-Based-on-Raspberry-Pi-Python-OpenCV-tfLite
This system is to detect mask and temperature for COVID-19 Precautions with 99% accuracy, based on Python and OpenCV. I have used TensorFlow to train the model for mask detection and then converted the model into tflite for Raspberry Pi implementation.
